The carpet upstairs was white so after a few years of living there it had become stained with various spills throughout the years (I am guilty of many of those, drinking coffee while watching Netflix in bed just hits different). Naturally, we had two options; either deep clean the carpet or get the carpet removed and install flooring. The main problem with the latter option was that our stairs were also carpeted which meant also getting those changed. After hearing the quotes from various flooring contractors, I was astonished by how costly this project would be. We had 600 square feet of flooring to renovate and most contractors were charging almost $5/square foot amounting to a cost of almost $3000 just for the floor. The stairs would be an extra $2000 - $3000 as stairs require more labour to renovate since its not as simple as laying down new material."

The first major problem I came across was deciding whether to use transition pieces through each room to hallway or have seamless transitions. I consulted my father's friend about this and he said transition pieces would make the job significantly easier but also takes away from the professionality of the job. So, I decided to go with seamless transitions. The difficulty with seamless transitions is that laminate flooring can only be installed in one direction, therefore, all the flooring has to start on one wall and when coming out of the door into the hallway, the hallway pieces have to be pre-installed to match exactly where it would meet coming out of the door. This required careful measurement and planning which took me almost an entire day to figure out and execute."

The edge was not too difficult to match through careful and precise cuts, however, the height of the finished wood pieces was just a little bit too low as after removing the carpets, the floor was not exactly level. For this, I thought of using some underlay install at various points under the finished wood pieces to raise just enough to match the floor. I then used counter sunk screws to install the finished wood pieces and filled the tops with wood filler to make it look as though they were built into the floor."

All the bannisters needed to be installed in the exact position they were previously so that the railing will attach to the wall and the stair post. The bannisters on the stairs were no problem as we did not touch the holes that they were removed from. However, the bannisters on the balcony needed have new holes drilled in the finished wood piece as the pieces covered up the existing holes. We consulted another one of my father's friends about how to go about this and his first idea was to measure out the distances between each bannister and mark them. While this idea was good in theory, I saw some immediate problems with it. Most importantly, it would be extremely tedious to measure out each distance perfectly and there is still bound to be a great deal of error. To this, I thought of a very simple yet effective solution. We could use the metal piece that would attach on top of the bannisters as stencil for where to mark. All we would have to do is lay it out on the right spot and use the holes in the metal to mark our holes. My father's friend thought this idea was ingenious and it eventually worked out perfectly."

As we needed 2 coats for both the stain and finish, this would a lot of time that nobody could use the stairs. Since my parents had work most days, I figured out the days that they both would be home so that I could apply the stain in those 2 days. For the finish, since my mom was the first to leave at 5am in the morning, I told my parents to go upstairs at 5pm  so that I could apply the finish and by the time they have to get up, they can use the stairs. I provided food for them through a ladder and the balcony on these 2 days."

I also managed to follow the project plan almost exactly to complete the project in exactly 3 weeks. While this project might not be directly related to my field of engineering, it taught me a lot about project management and dealing with technical problems with the resources that are available."
