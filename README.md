# Portfolio Site
[Portfolio website](https://ammarahmed.ca) created using React and Bootstrap

# Why React? 
Prior to creating this website, I had made a prototype using pure HTML/CSS and JavaScript, however, since I wanted to include dark and light mode functionality, vanilla HTML/CSS would not allow for the dark mode setting to be persisted across different pages. For this reason, I decided to use React as it allows for state management using React Hooks. This allowed for the darkmode setting to be persisted across the different pages. 

Another reason for using react was to allow for content to be added dynamically. As in I can write out content for projects that I have and use a single template to dynamically show the content dependent on the page. This will allow me to easily add new project pages without having to write out entire webpages each time. I can also seamlessly transition this static site into a full-stack dynamic site and create a post creator page for admin and add content through the live site itself. This is a feature that is not currently implemented but might be later on. 

# Why Bootstrap?
Bootstrap allows for very simple responsive styling. I did not want to spend too much time fiddling with media queries so Bootstrap made the process a lot simpler. Bootstrap also provides classes for dark and light backgrounds and text which made the dark mode functionality a lot easier to implement. 

# Why Firebase? 
Firebase allows for command-line deploying and it's also free for the purposes of this site which made it very simple to host and update. Another plus point is that adding domains is very seamless when using a Google domain.
